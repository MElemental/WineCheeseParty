* Cheese Board
In order to have a wine and cheese party we must prepare a cheese board.
A cheese board has two elements the cheese and the food pairings that complement it.
The cheese usually involves at least 5 types of cheeses on a board in a clockwise direction:
| Cheese-Type     | Example             |
|-----------------+---------------------|
| goat cheese     | goat cheese         |
| soft rind       | brie                |
| firm(semi-hard) | Cheddar             |
| hard cheese     | Parmigiano-Reggiano |
| Bleu Cheese     | blue cheese         |

The following table provides the cheese and possible food pairings.

  Wine serves to accompany a variety of different food.
  We can pair wine to the flavors of cheese.
